rrLogit News

CHANGES IN version 0.9.0

   * got started

CHANGES IN version 0.9.1

   * added predict and impute functions
   * added method="MCMC" and method="approxBayes" to rrLogit
   * added several more functions to extract information from an rrLogit object
   

CHANGES IN version 0.9.2
   * no different from version 0.9.1; change in version number wasn't necessary

CHANGES IN version 0.9.5
   * replaced .Fortran with .Call, which now allows us to pass arrays with
   total length exceeding 2^31-1 elements. Each array dimension, however,
   must be no longer than 2^31-1 or 2.147 billion.

CHANGES IN version 0.9.6
   * replaced .Call with .C64 from dotCall64

CHANGES IN version 0.9.7
   * no longer depends on matrixcalc package
   * rrLogit(): changed boundary warning to note when
   saturated=FALSE, removed it when saturated=TRUE
   * rrLogit(): solved problem in checking for singular perturbation
   matrix by changing from is.singular.matrix() to qr()$rank
   * coef.rrLogit(): removed warning when saturated=TRUE
   * anova.rlogit(): replaced resid.df column with nParams when
   method="lrt" or "logP"; fixed problem with method="BIC"
   * fitted.rrLogit(): fixed bug that threw an error when noisy=TRUE
   * fitted.rrLogit() and residuals.rrLogit(): added the arguments
   include.predvars and digits
   * revised man pages for cig2019, rrPertMat, rrPerturbResponse,
   fitted.rrLogit, residuals.rrLogit
   * impute.rrLogit(): warning about no frequencies changed to a
   message; fixed problem with microdata levels
   * rrLogit(): fixed incorrect SIGNATURE producing error in impList()
   * impList: fixed problem with microdata levels
   
CHANGES IN version 0.9.8
   * print.miInference: removed extraneous stop()

CHANGES IN version 0.9.9
   * predict.rrLogit: fixed problem with standard errors when noisy=TRUE

CHANGES IN version 1.0.0
   * rrLogit(): implemented step-halving for Newton-Raphson, Fisher scoring
   and the M-step of EM
   * rrLogit(): fixed problem with saturated=TRUE; when the RHS of provided
   model formula has extraneous interactions, it is replaced by a
   main-effects-only formulation. For example, Y ~ X1 + X2*X3 is
   replaced by Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3
   * impute.rrLogit: result is now a data frame, rather than a vector or
   matrix. When newdata is supplied, the variables in newdata appear in
   the result, and the suffix ".imp" is added to the name of the imputed
   true response to distinguish it from the observed noise-infused response
   * revised man pages and test suite
   
CHANGES IN version 1.0.1
   * rrLogit.formula: fixed problem with intercept-only model when
     saturated=TRUE
   * print.summary.rrLogit: added printed summaries for method="MCMC"
   * added new file unemployment.R to tests
